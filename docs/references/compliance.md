|2     |by PD 1096 1.10 meters (or 1100 mm) is the minimum required clear width of any public corridor intended for occupant egress.  The 1.10 m clear width must be unobstructed â€” meaning things like handrails, projections, or furniture should not reduce this required minimum. Wider corridors may be required depending on the occupant load or specific occupancy (like schools, hospitals, or high-density areas). For accessible corridors under BP 344 (Accessibility Law), the minimum width is also 1.20 meters to accommodate wheelchair users.

|21    |Electrical, Mechanical and utility rooms with exposure to fire generation should have a minimum of 2 hours fire rating and also improve the acoustics for areas around it, note that these areas emits high temperature and Air-conditioning system and maintainance of these equipments should be considered. Door/s fire rating should match the wall.  Door sizes- should consider the biggest equipment dimension going in/out of the space in an event of maintenance, beware of the opening and jamb size, the clear opening should be measured on the interior side of the door leaf when it is open Ceiling- if there is a ceiling, should be fire rated and the slab above it to have water proofing particularly if it is in the roofdeck, or there is a tenant above, this also prevents transfer of temperature which will result to moisture development on the floor which is lower in temperature, for exposed ceiling, it is recommend to have both waterproofing and insulation on soffit, the water proofing should be applied after all the hangering systems were drilled to the slab to ensure effective coverage Floor- For critical rooms with Critical IT equipment, ensure to validate the grounding requirement is only in the racks, there are clients which will require full grounding coverage in the raised floor pedestal, either in loop perimeter set-up or interlaced pedestal to pedestal, if using anti-static vinyl direct to floor, grounding strips will need to be set on the floor prior to the anti-static tile.

This design ensures that in the event of an emergency, rescuers can easily enter the cubicle if the occupant has fallen and is lying behind the door. Additionally, the locks and latches on these doors should be operable from the outside using a simple device, such as a coin, to facilitate assistance during emergencies. The IRR also suggests considering the use of sliding or folding doors, which require less space for maneuvering, and automatic push-button doors where feasible, as they are easier to operate and navigate around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |BP 344                                                         |

|26    |Nos. of Doors for 10 person and above rooms.  The Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) enforces this requirement to ensure safe egress in case of emergencies. The Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), which oversees the development and operation of economic zones, also adheres to this standard in its building regulations. Therefore, both agencies align in requiring two exits for rooms with 10 or more occupants.â€‹  In summary, the correct interpretation is that two exit doors are required for rooms with 10 or more occupants, as stipulated by the National Building Code and enforced by both the BFP and PEZA. The Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) enforces this requirement to ensure safe egress in case of emergencies. The Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), which oversees the development and operation of economic zones, also adheres to this standard in its building regulations. Therefore, both agencies align in requiring two exits for rooms with 10 or more occupants.â€‹  Double doors (paired doors) can count as two exits â€” but only if they meet specific requirements such as: 1. Independently Operable: Each leaf of the double door must be able to open independently. If theyâ€™re just decorative or one leaf is fixed (like bolted shut), it doesnâ€™t count as two exits.  2. Clear Width: Each leaf must provide a minimum clear width of 0.80 meters (about 32 inches). So, if you have two 0.80 m leaves, youâ€™re good â€” as long as both are operable.  3. Direction of Swing: Doors must swing in the direction of egress travel if the room serves 50 or more occupants or is a high-hazard area. For rooms with only 10, this may not be required, but it's still best practice.  4. Separation (only in some cases): If you're using two separate doors (not double doors), they should be remote from each other, so a single fire event canâ€™t block both. But this doesn't apply to double doors since theyâ€™re a single opening â€” so no need for separation there.  |PD 1096                                                        |
